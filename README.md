# eip-nrf-lib

This repository is a subset of the [Nordic Semiconductor SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf).

It primarily contains Zephyr abstractions for [nRF RTOS agnostic libraries](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib).

The imported files are manually curated to ensure that licensing violations of the following clause do not occur:
```
4. This software, with or without modification, must only be used with a Nordic Semiconductor ASA integrated circuit.
```
To comply with this condition, only libraries directly related or compatible with nRF hardware are imported.
